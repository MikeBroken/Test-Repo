Joe is a new man on a construction crew. 
The first day on the job, he opens his lunch box and mumbles, “Oh no, peanut butter!” 
The next day, “Peanut butter again!” This goes on for days, until another worker says, “Why don’t you ask your wife to make a different lunch?” 
Joe replies, “I’m not married. I make my own lunch.”
